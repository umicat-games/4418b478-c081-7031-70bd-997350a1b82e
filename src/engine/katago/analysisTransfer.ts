 * The buffers behind an analysis payload, each named exactly once.
 *
 * A transfer list may not name the same ArrayBuffer twice: `postMessage`
 * rejects that with `DataCloneError: Duplicate transferable for structured
 * clone`, which fails the whole analysis rather than the one move that
 * aliased. The payload can legitimately alias. When the search will not be
 * reused `getAnalysis` skips cloning and hands back the tree's own arrays, and
 * graph search lets a transposition put two root edges on one child node — so
 * two moves in the same top-K carry the identical ownership array, which is
 * the correct answer for two moves that reach the same position.
 *
 * Deduping keeps the payload whole: structured clone rebuilds every view over
 * the single transferred buffer, so the receiver still sees both moves'
 * ownership, still sharing one buffer the way the worker had it.
